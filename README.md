Hi, I’m David 👋 a web developer focused on web accessibility. I build WCAG AA–compliant sites for charities as part of my learning journey in programming.

**Projects**

  - **WordPress WCAG Theme Development & Mega Menu**

A WordPress Theme Project.

The theme was built from scratch with a strong focus on accessibility and performance, following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. 
The aim was to create a reusable base theme that could be adapted for future websites. https://github.com/dHolmesPortfolio/HolmesPortfolio
