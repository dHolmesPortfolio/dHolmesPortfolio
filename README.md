Hi, I’m David 👋 a web developer focused on web accessibility. 

# Projects
## HolmesPortfolio - CheckinApp
 - **This web application was created to showcase and practise JavaScript skills.** - https://github.com/dHolmesPortfolio/HolmesPortfolio-CheckinApp

  It has a check-in and check-out button
  Collect some data and uses an API
  Record the time in and out automatically
(no data is stored in the demo version, and no real api is used for car details due to api key needed. It does use the .gov.uk holiday API for the nearest holiday).

## A WordPress Theme Project.
  - **WordPress WCAG Theme Development & Mega Menu** - https://github.com/dHolmesPortfolio/HolmesPortfolio
The theme was built from scratch with a strong focus on accessibility and performance, following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. 
The aim was to create a reusable base theme that could be adapted for future websites.
