Hi, I’m David 👋 Early-stage web developer focused on web accessibility. I build WCAG AA–compliant sites for charities as part of my learning journey in programming.

**Projects**

  - **WordPress WCAG Theme Development & Mega Menu**

This is my biggest project so far, taking nearly **9 months** to complete.

The goal was to build a reusable WordPress theme backend, I wanted to be able to repurposed it for future projects, requiring only CSS and other visual changes. Accessibility was the main key focus throughout, with it based around **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.
The second biggest part of this project was the Mega menu build.
