Hi, I’m David 👋 Early-stage web developer focused on web accessibility. I build WCAG AA–compliant sites for charities as part of my learning journey in programming.

**Projects**

  - **WordPress WCAG Theme Development & Mega Menu**

This is my biggest project so far, taking nearly **9 months** to complete.

The goal was to build a reusable WordPress theme backend that could be repurposed for future projects, requiring only CSS and visual changes. Accessibility was a key focus throughout, with the theme designed to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards and include a fully accessible mega menu.
